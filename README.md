# Chatter

Chat application built with a Go server and Flutter client.

## Motivation

Just having some fun with a simple project. Wanted to play around with
Go channels and this seems like a relatively straightfowarded way of
doing that. Also wanted to play around more with Flutter, can try out
their new web build at the same time for the client.
